    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.&mdash;NAMED AT LAST.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>f one has a fairy
      tale in mind, why then, of course, the more mystery the better; but when
      you have a story to tell about people who cannot fly from hill-top to
      hill-top, and who to live at all must have food more substantial than
      rose-leaves and honey-dew, why then, say I, the less mystery the better.
      Therefore, let me tell you at once that the Courage of this story is not
      at all the sort of thing you might at first imagine. Auburn-haired,
      brown-eyed, and rosy-cheeked was this particular Courage; in point of
      fact, as charming a little maiden as you would meet on a long day's
      journey, and with Courage for her name. An odd name no doubt you think it.
      Courage herself did not like it, but the suns of a half-dozen summers and
      winters had risen for the little lady in question before she could so much
      as lay claim to any name whatsoever. All that while she was simply known
      as Baby Masterson. Her father, Hugh Masterson, was foreman in a machine
      shop over on the west side of the city, and &ldquo;a very queer man,&rdquo; people
      said. Probably they were right about it. He was unquestionably a very
      clever man, and queerness and cleverness seem to go hand-in-hand the world
      over. He was the author of at least three successful inventions, but, as
      often happens, others made more money out of them than he. Hugh,
      nevertheless, did not seem inclined to grumble at this state of affairs.
      Having a wife whom he loved devotedly and a comfortable home of his own,
      he felt thoroughly contented and happy. Then when, one bright June
      morning, Hugh found himself the father of a lovely baby daughter, happy
      was no name for it, and he was quite beside himself with joy. But, sadly
      enough, the joy was soon over, for scarcely three months after the
      baby-life came into the little home the mother-life went out of it, and
      then it seemed to poor Hugh as though his heart would break. He hired a
      kind-hearted woman named Mary Duff to care for his baby, and plunged
      harder than ever into his work, hoping by delving away at all sorts of
      difficult problems to grow less mindful of his great sorrow; but do what
      he would, there was always a sense of irreparable loss hanging over him.
      However, between his work and his sorrow he did often succeed in
      altogether forgetting his baby. Still the little daughter grew and
      flourished, apparently none the worse for this neglect. Mary Duff was love
      and tenderness itself, and it were well for the children if every mother
      in name were just such a mother at heart. But at last there came a time
      when Hugh Masterson could no longer fail to notice his baby's charms. She
      had taken it into her wise little head to grow prettier and prettier, and
      more and more cunning with every day, till there was no more forgetting of
      her possible; and first thing her father knew, he found himself thinking
      of her right in the midst of his work, and then hurrying home through the
      crowds of laboring people at night, fairly longing for a sight of her. And
      so it happened that the little girl grew to fill a larger and still larger
      place In his life, till on her sixth birthday he decided that she really
      ought to have a name, that little woman beginning strongly to resent the
      fact that she was known only as Baby Masterson to the small world in which
      she lived. So when Sunday came, Hugh carried her in his arms up to St.
      Paul's to be christened. But the name that he gave her! Well, it was not
      in the least like other little girls' names, as you know. No wonder Mary
      Duff, who was standing godmother, was more than surprised when she heard
      it, having simply taken for granted that Baby would be named for her
      mother. Baby herself was naturally greatly mystified at the whole
      proceeding.

    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say I had been, papa?&rdquo; she asked, as with her hand held fast
      in his she trudged home beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said you had been christened, darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christened!&rdquo; she repeated softly, wondering just what the word might
      mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you say I had a name now, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear; and you think it was time, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have wanted one for a very long while,&rdquo; she said, with a little half
      sigh; &ldquo;but did you say my name was Courage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Courage; it's a pretty name, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; rather doubtfully. &ldquo;Do other little girls have it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I believe not; but probably they don't deserve it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to have been named Arabella,&rdquo; she replied, somewhat
      aggrieved. &ldquo;Why did you not let me choose, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I never thought of that, Baby; besides, it isn't customary to
      consult children about what names they shall have&mdash;is it, Mary?&rdquo;
       turning to Mary Duff, who, because of the narrow flagging, was walking
      just behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I believe not, Mr. Masterson,&rdquo; said Mary; &ldquo;but then, sir, no more is
      it customary to delay a naming of them till they're old enough to be
      consulted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon Mary's right about that, Baby, and perhaps I ought to have
      talked matters over with you; but I can tell you one thing, I never should
      have consented to Arabella&mdash;never in this world. I should say
      Arabella was a regular doll name, and not at all suited to a sturdy-limbed
      little girl like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are other beautiful names, papa&mdash;Edith and Ethel and
      Helen! I love Helen.&rdquo; Then suddenly coming to a standstill and eagerly
      looking up to her father's face, she exclaimed: &ldquo;Papa, if we hurried back
      perhaps the minister would un-un-christen me&rdquo;&mdash;proud to have
      remembered the proper word and evidently comprehending that the rite was a
      binding one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I fear not,&rdquo; laughed her father; &ldquo;but take my word for it, you'll
      like Courage after a while; it's just the name for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it mean something, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, something fine. Why, when you grow up, Baby&rdquo; (for the new name was
      quite too new for use), &ldquo;you'll discover that there's nothing finer than
      courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is courage something that people have? Have I got it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people, dear, and I hope that you have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why am I named it, if you are not sure, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because then perhaps the name may help you to get it; but the best reason
      of all is this, that the sight of you, darling, always puts new courage
      into me and although she did not in the least understand it, Baby felt
      somehow that that was a beautiful reason, and as her father lifted her up
      in his arms, gave him a tight little hug and was perfectly satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like my new name?&rdquo; she said, looking over her father's
      shoulder at Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, darling.&rdquo; said Mary, taking hold of her little extended hand, &ldquo;I
      thought it some queer at the first, but now that I've learned the reason,
      I think it's an elegant name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may be that you do not agree with Mary Duff in this, and yet you must
      know that it was just because Courage proved to be so well named that
      there is this little story to tell about her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;ON THE WATCH.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t the time of the
      commencement of our story Courage was twelve years old. To be sure, she
      was only six over in that little first chapter, but to be quite honest,
      that wasn't a first chapter at all. It was simply what is termed an
      introduction, but we did not dare to mention the fact, because, if you
      will believe it, that is something many people cannot be persuaded to
      read. So the real story commences with a twelve-year-old Courage standing
      one May morning on the edge of a wharf at the foot of a West side street.
      The wind was tossing her auburn hair and winding her little plaid skirt
      close about her, but was not strong enough by half to blow a sad, wistful
      look from her brown eyes. Morning after morning she had taken her position
      at exactly the same spot, and there had sat or stood for hours at a time.
      The men who worked on the wharf had come to know her, and some of them to
      wish her a cherry good-morning as she tripped by. It was evident that she
      was watching for somebody, and that the somebody did not come. After
      awhile they began to feel sorry for her, and finally one of them&mdash;Big
      Bob they called him&mdash;resolved to stroll out to where she was standing
      that breezy May morning and have a word with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be yez watchin' for some one, miss?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Courage; &ldquo;I've been watching a great many days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what the men was a-noticin', miss. Is it for yer father ye're
      lookin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not for him and there was a sadness in her voice which even the big
      burly Scotchman was not slow to detect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mayhap ye've no longer a right to be lookin' for him on ony o' this
      world's waters,&rdquo; said the man, gazing down sympathetically over the ledge
      of his great folded arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courage bit her lip, and the tears sprang into her eyes, but she managed
      to answer, &ldquo;My father died two weeks ago, sir&mdash;just two weeks ago
      to-day,&rdquo; while the man looked the sympathy he could not speak. &ldquo;That is
      why I am watching for Larry,&rdquo; Courage added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Larry!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Is it for Larry Starr ye're watchin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Courage, as though she thought any one should have known
      that; &ldquo;do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do. Every 'longshoreman knows Larry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen him lately?&rdquo; very eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not for a twelvemonth; but come to think of it, he often ties up at
      this very wharf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, often,&rdquo; said Courage; &ldquo;but it's two months now since he's been here,
      and he never stays away so long as that. You don't think&rdquo;&mdash;she paused
      a moment, as though afraid to give words to her fears&mdash;&ldquo;you don't
      think, do you, that he can have died too, somewhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor little Courage! with her mother dead since her babyhood and her
      father lately gone from her, no wonder she felt it more than possible that
      Larry would never come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, miss,&rdquo; said the man reassuringly; &ldquo;he'd never a-died without our
      a-hearin' of it; still, it's some old he's a-gettin', is Larry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a good strong man yet, though,&rdquo; Courage replied, not willing to
      admit the possibility of waning powers in her hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, and I know he's a good man, miss, and no doubt, too, but his
      strength will be as his day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't know anything about where he is now?&rdquo; Courage asked rather
      hopelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not for this twelvemonth, as I was a-tellin' ye; but like as not some
      of the men has heard some word on him. Gang back wi' me and we'll speir
      'em a question or two,&rdquo; whereupon he extended his hand, which Courage took
      rather reluctantly, it was such a powerful-looking hand; but there proved
      to be nothing rough in the way it closed over the small brown hand she
      placed in it. So side by side, in this friendly fashion, they walked up
      the dock to where the men were unloading a Southern steamer.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Has ony o' ye heard a word o' Larry Starr o' late?&rdquo; called Big Bob, but
      in a tone so different from the one in which he had spoken to Courage,
      that she gave a little start of surprise, and then hoped he had not seen
      it. Most of the men shook their heads in the negative. &ldquo;Niver a wurrud,&rdquo;
       answered an old Irishman. Indeed, only one of the number made no reply
      whatsoever, so that Courage thought he could not have heard. It was his
      place to free the huge iron hook from the bales, after they had been
      landed on the wharf, and he seemed all absorbed in his work. Fortunately,
      however, he had heard, and as he stood watching the hook as it slowly
      swung back aboard of the vessel, he called out, &ldquo;Yes, I has some word on
      him, Bob; anybody 'quiring for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O' course there is, just the verra little leddy what I've here by the
      hand. If ye'd eyes worth the name, John, ye'd seen her 'fore this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is it you, miss?&rdquo; said John, looking for the first time toward
      Courage, and at once recognizing the little girl who had been so long on
      the watch. &ldquo;Well, then, I can tell ye he'll be at this wharf this day
      week, certain. The Lady Bird's due here on Friday or Saturday, and Larry's
      under contract to carry part of her cargo down to the stores Monday
      morning. It's a pity, miss, you hadn't asked me afore, I could a-told you
      the same any day back for a fortni't. But run down bright and early next
      Monday morn-in', and take my word for it, you'll find Larry's lighter
      swinging up to this wharf, as sure as my name's Jack Armstrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courage, meantime, had grown radiant. &ldquo;Oh, he'll come sooner than that!&rdquo;
       she exclaimed exultingly. &ldquo;He'll tie up Saturday night and spend Sunday
      with us. He always does that when he has work at this pier for Monday.&rdquo;
       Then, looking up to Big Bob, she said gratefully, &ldquo;Thank you very much for
      finding out for me. I will run right home now and tell Mary Duff,&rdquo; and
      suiting the action to the word, Courage was at the wharf's end and up the
      street and out of sight before the slow-moving longshoremen had fairly
      settled to work again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Courage was sure that Larry was coming, as sure as though it had
      been flashed across the blue May sky in letters of silver, all the hours
      of weary foreboding and waiting were quite forgotten. So true is it, as
      Celia Thaxter sings in that peerless song of hers, as brave as any bird
      note, and as sweet:=

      CHAPTER III.&mdash;LARRY COMES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>trange as it still
      may appear to you that a little girl should have Courage for her name,
      yet, true it is, that she was no sooner named herself than she had a
      namesake. It was none of your little baby namesakes either, but a stanch
      and well-built boat, and one that was generally admitted to be the finest
      craft of her class in the harbor. The Courage Masterson was what is
      commonly known as a lighter, and to whom of course did she belong but to
      Larry Starr, Hugh Masterson's best friend; but she was no common lighter,
      I can assure you. Larry had given his whole mind to her building, and it
      was unlike any of the other lighters that make their way up and down the
      river or out on the bay, with their great cumbersome loads. She had a fine
      little cabin of her own, a cosey, comfortable cabin, with two state-rooms,
      if you can give them so fine a title, opening out of it, and a tiny
      kitchen beyond, lighted by a small sky-window. All this, as any one knows,
      was very luxurious, but Larry had put the savings of many years into that
      boat, and he meant to have it as he liked it. To be sure, the cabin,
      occupying as it did some twenty square feet, greatly lessened her carrying
      capacity, for one square foot on the deck of a lighter stands for
      innumerable square feet of merchandise, which may be piled to almost any
      height upon it. Larry was quite willing, however, to lose something from
      the profits of every trip for the sake of the added comfort. But it was
      six years now since the lighter had been launched, and so it had happened
      that all that time, while the little girl Courage had been having a
      variety of experiences on land, the big boat Courage had been sailing
      under &ldquo;fair skies and foul&rdquo; on the water, and safely transporting many a
      cargo that netted a comfortable living for Larry. And now Saturday
      afternoon had come, and Courage was down in her old place at the dock's
      end with a happy certainty in her eyes, and yet with a sorrowful look
      overshadowing it, for there was such sad news to be told when at last
      Larry should come, and at last he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0006" id="linkimage-0006"> </a>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Courage first thought she discovered a familiar boat away down the river,
      and then in a moment there was no longer a doubt of it. The lighter, with
      her one broad sail spread to the wind, came slowly nearer and nearer, and
      Courage in her eagerness stood way out on the farthermost corner of the
      dock, so that Larry caught sight of her long before she put her two hands
      to her mouth, trumpet fashion, and called, &ldquo;Hello there, Larry,&rdquo; at the
      top of her strong little lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello there, Courage,&rdquo; rang back Larry's cheery answer, as leaning hard
      against the tiller, he swung his boat into place with the skill of a
      long-time sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you'd find out somehow that I was coming,&rdquo; he called, and then in
      another second he was ashore and had Courage's two hands held fast in his,
      and was gazing gladly into her face. But instantly the look of greeting in
      her eyes faded out of them. She could find no words for the sad news she
      had to tell. Larry was quick to see her trouble, and his voice trembled as
      he asked, &ldquo;Why, Courage, child, what has happened?&rdquo; and then he drew her
      to a seat beside him on a great beam that flanked the wharf.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0007" id="linkimage-0007"> </a>

      <a href="images/0027.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      It was easier to speak, now that she could look away from Larry's
      expressive face, and she said slowly, &ldquo;The saddest thing that could
      happen, Larry. Papa&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and then she could go no further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean that your father is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but neither could Larry
      bring himself to voice the fatal, four-lettered little word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Courage, knowing well enough that he understood her, &ldquo;nearly
      three weeks ago. He had typhoid fever, and he tried very hard to get well,
      and we all tried so hard, Larry&mdash;the Doctor and Mary Duff and me&mdash;but
      the fever was the kind that wouldn't break. And then one day papa just
      said, 'It isn't any use, darling. I'm going to give up the fight and go to
      your blessed mother, but you need have never a fear, Courage, while Larry
      Starr is in the world.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say that really?&rdquo; asked Larry, tears of which he was not ashamed
      rolling down his bronzed face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Courage solemnly; &ldquo;but oh, Larry, I have been waiting here for
      so many days that I began to think perhaps you would never come, and if
      you hadn't come, Larry&mdash;&rdquo; and then the recollection of all these
      hours of watching proved quite too much for her overwrought little frame,
      and burying her face in her hands on Larry's knee, she cried very
      bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is best,&rdquo; thought Larry, &ldquo;to let her have her cry out.&rdquo; Besides he was
      not sure enough of his own voice to try to comfort her, so he just stroked
      the auburn hair gently with his strong hand, and said not a word.
      Meanwhile another old friend had come upon the scene, and stood staring at
      Larry and Courage with a world of questioning in his eyes. He seemed to
      have his doubts at first as to the advisability of coming nearer. He
      discovered, it was evident, that there was trouble in the air. That he was
      greatly interested, and fully expected to be confided in sooner or later,
      was also evident from the beseeching way in which he would put his head on
      one side and then on the other, looking up to Larry, as much as to say,
      &ldquo;When are you going to tell me what it is all about?&rdquo; But never a word
      from Larry and never a glance from Courage, till at last such ignominious
      treatment was no longer to be borne, and walking slowly up, he also laid
      his head upon Larry's knee. Courage felt something cold against her cheek
      and started up to find a pair of wonderfully expressive eyes raised
      beseechingly to hers. &ldquo;Oh, Bruce, old fellow,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I forgot all
      about you,&rdquo; and then, flinging her arms about his neck, she literally
      dried her tears on his beautiful silky coat. But Bruce would not long be
      content with mere passive acceptance of affection, and in another second
      rather rudely shook himself free from her grasp, and began springing upon
      her, so that she had to jump to her feet and cry, &ldquo;Down, Bruce,&rdquo; three or
      four times before he would mind her; but Bruce was satisfied. Things could
      not have come to such a terrible pass if it took no more than that to make
      Courage seem her old self again, and finally, concluding that she really
      said &ldquo;Down, Bruce,&rdquo; quite as though she meant it, he decided to give his
      long legs a good run, and call on an old collie friend of his who picked
      up a living on Pier 17. Never, however, had visit of sympathetic friend
      proved as timely as this call of Bruce's. With what infinite tact had he
      first sympathized with and then tried to cheer his little friend! And he
      had succeeded, for both Larry and Courage now found themselves able to
      talk calmly of all that had happened, and of what had best be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you would like to come on the lighter with me for the summer,&rdquo; said
      Larry somewhat doubtfully, after they had been conferring for some time
      together, and yet with his old face brightening at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courage simply nodded her head in the affirmative, but her eyes said, &ldquo;Oh,
      wouldn't I, Larry,&rdquo; as plainly as words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mary Duff thinks it would be all right, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very best thing for the summer, Larry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, bless your heart, you shall come; but how about next winter?
      Why, then I suppose I shall have to send you away to a school somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courage shrugged her shoulders rather ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but next winter's a long way off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Larry, every whit as glad of the fact as was Courage
      herself. &ldquo;And you said,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that Mary Duff is going to care
      for that little lame Joe of John Osborne's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Courage answered, &ldquo;though Mr. Osborne can't afford to pay her
      anything, as papa did for me; but she says she doesn't mind; if she only
      has her home and her board she can manage, and that it's just her life to
      care for motherless little children that need her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but that Mary Duff's a good woman,&rdquo; said Larry, and Courage mutely
      shook her head from side to side, as though it were quite hopeless to so
      much as attempt to tell how very good she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      After awhile Larry went down to the boat to give some directions to his
      cabin-boy, Dick, and Courage went with him. When that was completed, a
      long shrill whistle brought Bruce bounding from some mysterious quarter,
      and the three started up the dock. The 'longshoremen were just quitting
      work as they neared them, and Larry paused to have a word with Big Bob and
      the other men whom he knew, Courage keeping fast hold of his hand all the
      while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now she's got him she don't mean to let him go,&rdquo; said one of the men as
      they passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to be in Larry's shoes, then,&rdquo; muttered Big Bob, who led rather
      a lonely life of it, and would have been only too glad to have had such a
      little girl as Courage confided to his keeping.

      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;MISS JULIA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was &ldquo;high noon&rdquo;
       in New York, as our English cousins say, but in a wider sense than our
      English cousins use it. Not only was it twelve by the clock, with the sun
      high in the heavens, flooding the streets with brilliant sunshine, but the
      whole city apparently was in the highest spirits. The sidewalks were alive
      with gayly dressed people, gayly liveried carriages rolled up and down the
      avenue, violets and lilacs were for sale at the flower-stands, and the
      children were out in crowds for an airing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a little group of them, with unspeakable longing in their hearts,
      surrounded a grimy man who had snow-white puppies for sale; there another
      and larger group watched a wonderful ship in a glass case, riding angular
      green waves which rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum, and
      some of them furtively glanced up now and then, with eyes full of
      astonished admiration, to the gray-bearded man who claims the honor of the
      invention.
    </p>
    <p>
      But notwithstanding it was Saturday, with half the world bent on a
      holiday, and schools as a rule at a discount, there was one school over on
      the West side that threw open its doors to an eager company of scholars.
      It was a school where the children came because they loved to come, and no
      wonder. You had only to see the teachers to understand it. They were
      lovely-looking girls, with their bright, wide-awake faces and becoming,
      well-fitting dresses; enthusiastic, earnest girls, thoroughly abreast of
      the times, interested in everything, and fond of all that is high and
      ennobling&mdash;working in the sewing school this afternoon, attractive
      matinées notwithstanding, and talking it over in some bright circle this
      evening; girls, the very sight of whom must somehow have done good to the
      very dullest little maids upon their roll books. But queen among even this
      peerless company reigned &ldquo;Miss Julia,&rdquo; the superintendent, or whatever the
      proper name may be for the head teacher. She was lovely to look at, and
      lovely in spirit, and beyond that it is useless to attempt description, so
      impossible is it to put into words the indefinable charm that won every
      one to her. But with the bright May Saturday, about which we are writing,
      the afternoon for closing the school had come, and there was a wistful
      expression on the faces of many of the children. Not that they were
      exactly anxious to stitch on and on through the spring-time, when every
      healthy little body loves out-of-door life and lots of it, but no sewing
      school meant no Miss Julia; so, with reason, they looked less glad than
      sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Julia, as was her custom, had started in abundance of time from her
      old-fashioned home in Washington Square, but not too early, it seemed, to
      find at a corner near the chapel where the school was held, half a dozen
      little girls already on the look-out. As soon as they spied her they
      flocked down the street to meet her, and then with her in their midst
      flocked back again. Presently, in twos and threes, the young teachers
      began to arrive, and soon it was time to open the school and to settle
      down to the last day's lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courage Masterson happened to be in Miss Julia's own class, and was
      ordinarily a most apt little scholar; but on this particular Saturday her
      thoughts seemed to be everywhere rather than on her work; indeed, she had
      to rip out almost every stitch taken, until Miss Julia wondered what could
      have happened. Afterward, when the children had said their good-byes and
      gone home, and the teachers, with the exception of Miss Julia, had all
      left the building, Courage, who had been standing unnoticed in one corner,
      rushed up to her, burying her red-brown curls in the folds of her dress
      and sobbing fit to break her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Courage, dear, what is the matter?&rdquo; and Miss Julia, sitting down on
      one of the benches, drew Courage into her lap. &ldquo;I was afraid all the
      lesson that something had gone wrong. Poor child! have you some new sorrow
      to bear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Julia; I am going to do just what I want to do most; I am going
      to live on a boat; but, oh! I can't bear to go away from you and Mary
      Duff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going away, and to live on a boat! why, how is that, Courage?&rdquo; and then
      as Courage explained all the plans, and how she was to spend the whole
      summer out on the bay with &ldquo;Larry, the goodest man that ever was,&rdquo; her sad
      little face gradually grew bright again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Miss Julia, after they had been talking a long while
      together, &ldquo;I am sure&rdquo;&mdash;and then she paused and looked Courage over
      quite carefully&mdash;- &ldquo;yes, I am sure I have something that will be just
      the thing for you now that you are to be so much on the water; wait here
      for a moment,&rdquo; and going into a little room that opened from the chapel,
      she immediately returned with something in her hands that made Courage
      open her eyes for wonder. It was a beautiful astrachan-trimmed blue coat,
      with a wide-brimmed hat to match. They had belonged to a little niece of
      Miss Julia's&mdash;a little niece who no longer had need for any
      earth-made garment, and so here they were in Miss Julia's hands awaiting
      some new child-ownership.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had already thought of Courage Masterson as one to whom they would
      prove not only useful but becoming, and yet had feared to excite the envy
      of the other children. But if Courage was going away, that settled it; she
      should have them; for in that case her less fortunate little sisters need
      never be the wiser. So Miss Julia gladly held them up to view, for she
      dearly loved little Courage, while Courage, incredulous, exclaimed: &ldquo;For
      me? Oh, Miss Julia!&rdquo; and proceeded to don the coat and hat with the
      alacrity of a little maid appreciative of their special prettiness. Then
      what did the little witch do but run post-haste to the rear of the chapel,
      mount the high and slippery organ-bench, and have a peep into the mirror
      above it. Miss Julia could not keep from smiling, but said, as she came
      running back: &ldquo;It does look nicely on you, Courage, but you must not let
      it make you vain, darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it vain to want to see how it looked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Courage; I don't believe it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad I did see just once, though, because, Miss Julia, I guess it
      will not do for me to have it,&rdquo; and Courage reluctantly began to unfasten
      the pretty buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not do for you to have it! Why, Courage dear, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so bright-looking, Miss Julia. Even this curly black stuff doesn't
      darken it much (admiringly smoothing the astrachan trimming with both
      little hands), and one of the girls said to-day in the class that 'orphans
      as had any heart always wore black.' At any rate, she said she shouldn't
      think if I had loved my father <i>very</i> much I'd wear a gay ribbon like
      this in my hair,&rdquo; whereupon Courage produced a crumpled red bow from the
      recesses of a pocket to which it had been summarily banished; &ldquo;So, of
      course, Miss Julia, it would be dreadful to wear a blue coat like this.
      It's queer Mary Duff never told me about orphans wearing black always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they do not always wear it, Courage. It seems sad to me to see a
      child in black, and I think Mary Duff did just right in not putting you
      into mourning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into mourning?&rdquo; queried Courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; into black dresses, I mean, because some one had died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courage looked critically at Miss Julia, noticing for the first time that
      her dress was black, and that even the little pin at her throat was black,
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miss Julia,&rdquo; she said, her voice fairly trembling with the surprise
      of the discovery, &ldquo;you are in mourning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did somebody die, Miss Julia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one I loved very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long ago?&rdquo; and Courage came close to the low bench, and lovingly laid her
      hand upon Miss Julia's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not your father or mother, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you mind still?&rdquo; ruefully shaking her head from side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Courage; I shall always mind, as you call it, but I am no longer
      miserable and unhappy&mdash;that is, not very often, and one reason is
      that all you little girls here in the school have grown so dear to me. But
      about the coat; you must surely keep it. I scarcely believe your father
      would like to have seen his little girl all in black; and besides, black
      does not seem to belong with that brave little name of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courage stood gazing into Miss Julia's face with a puzzled look in her
      eyes, as though facing the troublesome question. Then suddenly diving
      again into her spacious pocket&mdash;a feature to be relied upon in
      connection with Mary Duffs dressmaking&mdash;and evidently discovering
      what she sought, she said, eagerly: &ldquo;Miss Julia, will you wait here a
      moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, dear; but what are you up to?&rdquo; Courage, however, had no time
      to explain, and with the blue coat flying out behind her, darted from the
      chapel, across the street, into a little thread-and-needle store, and was
      back again in a flash, carrying a thin flimsy package. Hastily unwrapping
      it, she disclosed a yard of black ribbon, which she thrust into Miss
      Julia's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this for, Courage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In her excitement Courage simply extended her left arm with a &ldquo;Tie it
      round, please,&rdquo; indicating the place with her right hand. Miss Julia
      wonderingly did as she was bid.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0009" id="linkimage-0009"> </a>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0041.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tie a lovely bow,&rdquo; said Courage, twisting her neck to get a look at
      it. &ldquo;You know why I have it, don't you?&rdquo; Miss Julia looked doubtful. &ldquo;It's
      my mourning for papa. I have seen soldiers with something black tied round
      their arms because some other soldier had died, haven't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is it,&rdquo; said Miss Julia, very tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is it; and now you see I don't mind how bright the coat is&mdash;the
      little bow tells how I miss him. Will you just take a stitch in it,
      please, so that it will stay on all summer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Miss Julia reopened her little sewing-bag, and the stitches were taken,
      and a few moments later Courage was on her way home, proud enough of the
      beautiful coat and hat, and eager to show them to Mary Duff, and yet sad
      at heart, too, for she had said good-bye to &ldquo;Miss Julia.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.&mdash;SYLVIA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here had been a
      week of active preparation, and now everything was ready, and Mary Duff
      and Courage, seated on a new little rope-bound trunk, were waiting for
      Larry to come. The house looked sadly forlorn and empty, for Mary had sold
      most of the furniture, that the money it brought might be put in the bank
      for Courage, and the only thing yet to be done was to hand over the keys
      to the new tenant expecting to take possession on the morrow. Mary had
      intentionally arranged matters in just this fashion. It was not going to
      be an easy thing to say good-bye to the little girl she had so lovingly
      cared for since her babyhood, and she knew well enough that to come back
      alone to the old home would half break her heart; therefore she had wisely
      planned that it should be &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; to Courage and &ldquo;how do you do&rdquo; to
      little lame Joe in as nearly the same breath as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last there came a knock at the door, and Courage bounded to open it.
      Bruce, unmannerly fellow, crowded in first, and after Bruce, Larry, and
      after Larry&mdash;what? who? A most remarkable-looking object, with tight
      curling hair braided fine as a rope into six funny little pig-tails, with
      skin but a shade lighter than her coal-black eyes, and with a stiffly
      starched pink calico skirt standing out at much the same angle as the
      pig-tails. Mary Duff apparently was not in the least surprised at this
      apparition, but Courage stared in wide-eyed wonder. &ldquo;Oh, isn't she funny?&rdquo;
       were the words that sprang to her lips, but too considerate to give them
      utterance, she simply asked, &ldquo;Who is she, Larry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Sylvia,&rdquo; said Larry; &ldquo;Sylvia, this is Miss Courage,&rdquo; whereupon
      Sylvia gave a little backward kick with one foot, which she meant to have
      rank as a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is Sylvia?&rdquo; in a friendly voice that went straight to Sylvia's
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's to be company for you on the lighter, Courage, and a little maid of
      all work besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spesh'ly I'se to wash up,&rdquo; Sylvia volunteered, beaming from ear to ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Courage, with considerable dignity, seeming to
      realize at a bound the relation of mistress and maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean dat on boats dere's allers heaps an' heaps to wash up&mdash;pots an'
      kittles an' dishes an' lan' knows what&mdash;an' dat me's de one dat's
      gwine do it. A-washin' of demselves is all de washin' dat's 'spected of
      dose little lily white han's, Miss Courage, case de Cap'n say so&mdash;didn't
      yer, Cap'n?&rdquo; whereupon Sylvia gave a marvellous little pirouette on one
      foot, that made pigtails and skirt describe a larger circle than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's what I said,&rdquo; answered Larry, rather taken aback by this
      performance, and wondering if he had gotten more than he had bargained for
      in this sable little specimen, chosen somewhat at random from the half
      dozen presented for his inspection at an asylum the day before. But
      Courage had no fears, and saw in anticipation delightful opportunities for
      no end of fun, and, when it should be needed, for a little patronizing
      discipline. Meanwhile Bruce, who seemed unquestionably worried as to what
      sort of a move was pending, had made his way out of doors, and taken up
      his stand near the boy who stood in waiting with a hand-cart, ready to
      carry the trunk to the boat. When at last the trunk was in the cart, with
      Sylvia's bundle atop of it, and it became evident that the little party
      were actually on their way to the lighter, his delight knew no bounds, and
      he flew round and round after his tail, as a relief to his exuberant
      feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courage kept tight hold of Mary Duff's hand all the way. Of course it was
      going to be lovely out on the water all summer, and with Larry; but oh,
      how she wished Mary was to be there too! But that always seemed to be the
      way somehow&mdash;something very nice and something very sad along with
      it. Glancing ahead to Sylvia, who, with a jolly little swing of her own,
      was trotting along at the side of the cart, steadying her bundle with a
      very black hand, Courage wondered if she had found it so too, and resolved
      some day to ask her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good-byes were said rather hurriedly at the last. Mary Duff first went
      down into the cabin with Courage and helped to unpack her trunk. Then,
      when finally there was nothing more for her to do, there was just a good
      hard hug and two or three very hard kisses, and then you might have seen a
      familiar figure disappearing around the nearest corner of the dock, and
      Mary Duff was gone. As soon as she was out of sight she stopped a moment
      and wiped the tears from her eyes with a corner of her shawl, for they
      were fairly blinding her, and then hurried right on to the little cripple,
      to whom her coming was to prove the very most blessed thing that had ever
      happened. As for Courage, she went to her own little room and had a good
      cry there, and though neither of them knew of the other's tears, the skies
      soon looked clearer to them both. But there was one pair of eyes in which
      tears were not for a moment to be thought of. Tears! with the great orphan
      asylum left behind and all the delights of life on that beautiful boat
      opening out before her? No indeed! Let Miss Courage have her little cry
      out if she must, but for Sylvia, a face wreathed in smiles so broad as to
      develop not unfrequently into an audible chuckle. And so while Courage was
      trying to get herself in hand, for she did not want Larry to know how
      badly she felt, Sylvia, acting under orders, was as busy as could be,
      setting the table in the cabin, and making supper ready in the tiny
      kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Courage again came on deck, the lighter had cleared the wharf and was
      well out upon the river. Larry was at the helm, and she made her way
      straight to him and slipped her hand in his, as much as to say, &ldquo;I'm yours
      now, you know, Larry,&rdquo; and Larry gave it a tight little squeeze, as much
      as to say, &ldquo;Yes, I know you are, dear,&rdquo; and they understood each other
      perfectly, though not a word was spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think I had better call you uncle or something instead of just
      Larry?&rdquo; said Courage after she had stood silently at his side for ever so
      many minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Larry, amused at the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, because it doesn't seem right for a child like me to call you by your
      first name. I should have thought that they would have taught me
      different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bless your heart, Courage! nobody taught you what to call me..You
      just took up 'Larry' of yourself in the cutest sort of a way, and before
      you could say half-a-dozen words to your name, and now to tack an uncle on
      to it after all these years would sound mighty queer, and I shouldn't like
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, we'll just let it be Larry always,&rdquo; and indeed Courage
      herself was more than willing to have things remain as they were. As for
      Sylvia, she soon decided that her one form of address for Larry should be
      &ldquo;my Cap'n,&rdquo; for was he not in very truth <i>her</i> captain by grace of
      his choice of her from among all the other little colored orphans whom he
      might have taken? Indeed, Sylvia fairly seemed to revel in the
      two-lettered personal pronoun, for if there is a Saxon word for which the
      average institution child has comparatively little use it is that word <i>my</i>.
      Where children are cared for by the hundreds, <i>my</i> and <i>me</i> and
      <i>mine</i> and all that savors of the individual are almost perforce lost
      sight of. No wonder, then, when Sylvia said &ldquo;my Cap'n,&rdquo; it was in a tone
      implying a most happy sense of ownership, and as though it stood for the
      &ldquo;my father&rdquo; and &ldquo;my mother&rdquo; and all the other &ldquo;mys&rdquo; of more fortunate
      little children.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Sylvia's supper was ready, and before announcing the fact, she
      stood a moment, arms akimbo, taking a critical survey of her labors. Then,
      convinced that nothing had been forgotten, she cleared the cabin stairs at
      a bound, and beckoning to Larry and Courage, called out excitedly, &ldquo;Come
      'long dis minute, please, 'fore it all gets cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Larry, who had many misgivings as to the result of his protegee's first
      efforts, was greatly surprised on reaching the cabin to find a most
      tempting little table spread out before them, but it was hard to tell
      whether surprise or indignation gained the mastery In the eyes of
      astonished Courage. That the table looked most attractive no one could for
      a moment deny, but what most largely contributed thereto was a glorious
      bunch of scarlet geraniums, to compass which Sylvia had literally stripped
      a double row of plants standing in the cabin window of every flower. These
      plants had been Mary Duff's special pride for several seasons, and she
      herself had carefully superintended their transportation in a wheelbarrow
      to the lighter the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0010" id="linkimage-0010"> </a>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0051.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Who could marvel, then, that the tears came unbidden, as Courage at one
      glance took in the whole situation&mdash;the elaborate decorations, the
      sadly despoiled plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sylvia, how could you?&rdquo; was all she found words to say. Poor Sylvia,
      never more surprised in her life, stood aghast for a moment, looking most
      beseechingly to Larry. Then a possibility dawned upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am it dem posies, Miss Courage?&rdquo; and the question let the light in on
      Larry's bewildered mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I mean the flowers,&rdquo; said Courage, laying one hand caressingly
      on a poor little dismantled plant. &ldquo;You have not left a single one, and I
      wouldn't have had you pick them for all the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I was 'bliged to, Miss Courage,&rdquo; with all the aplomb of a
      conscientious performance of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obliged to?&rdquo; and then it seemed to occur simultaneously to Larry and
      Courage that they had possibly secured the services of a veritable little
      lunatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Courage; hab you neber hearn tell of a kitchen garden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Courage; and now she and Larry exchanged glances as to the
      certainty of Sylvia's mental condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'se a kitchen-garden grajate,&rdquo; Sylvia announced with no little
      pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my stars! if you're not a stark little idiot,&rdquo; muttered Larry under
      his breath, but fortunately Sylvia was too absorbed to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dere ain't much you kin tell a kitchen-garden grajate,&rdquo; she
      continued complacently, &ldquo;'bout setting tables and sich like. Dere's
      questions and answers 'bout eberyting, you know, an' when Miss Sylvester
      ses, 'What must yer hab in de middle ob de table?' the answer is, 'Fruit
      or flowers so as there wasn't no fruit, why&mdash;&rdquo; and Sylvia, pausing
      abruptly, gave a little shrug of her shoulders, and with a grandiloquent
      gesture, pointed to the geraniums, as though further words were
      superfluous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn't understand,&rdquo; said Courage, for both she and Larry were
      beginning to comprehend the situation, and a little later on, when they
      had had time to realize more fully the careful arrangement of the table,
      to say nothing of the tempting dishes themselves, they were ready to
      pronounce the little lunatic of a few moments previous a veritable
      treasure. The ham was done &ldquo;to a turn;&rdquo; the fried potatoes were
      deliciously crisp; dainty little biscuits fairly melted in your mouth; the
      coffee was perfection, and Sylvia sat beaming and radiant, for there was
      no lack of openly expressed appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say you were, Sylvia?&rdquo; asked Courage during the progress of
      the meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn't say I was nuffin 't all,&rdquo; nervously fearing that in some
      unconscious way she might again have offended her new little mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you did, don't you know?&rdquo; pretending not to notice the nervousness.
      &ldquo;It was something nice to be; it began with kitchen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Sylvia, much relieved, &ldquo;a kitchen-garden grajate. Want to
      see my di-diplomer?&rdquo; including both Larry and Courage in one glance as she
      spoke. Wholly mystified as to what the article might be, both of course
      nodded yes, whereupon Sylvia, plunging one little black fist down the neck
      of her dress, vainly endeavored to bring something to the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It kinder sticks,&rdquo; she explained confidentially, but in another second a
      shining medal attached to a blue ribbon came flying out with appalling
      momentum. &ldquo;Dere now,&rdquo; she said, giving a backward dive through the
      encircling ribbon, &ldquo;dat's what I got for larning all dere was to larn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courage took the medal and examined it. It was made of some bright metal,
      and was stamped with the figure of a girl with a broom in her hand. Across
      the top were the words &ldquo;Kitchen Garden,&rdquo; and on a little scroll at the
      bottom the name Sylvia Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do they call it a kitchen garden?&rdquo; asked Courage, passing the medal
      on for Larry's inspection; &ldquo;it's an awful funny name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory knows! ain't no sense in it, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that medal,&rdquo; added Courage, &ldquo;was a sort of a prize for doing things
      better than the others, wasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Courage, dat's a reg'lar diplomer. All de chillens in de school
      had 'em when, dey grajated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courage looked appealingly toward Larry, to see if he knew what she meant,
      and Larry looked just as appealingly to Courage. The truth was, Sylvia had
      the best of them both. To be sure, she used a pronunciation of her own,
      but it was near enough to the original to have suggested graduate and
      diploma to minds in anywise familiar with the articles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did they teach you to cook in the kitchen garden?&rdquo; Courage asked,
      feeling that she must remain quite hopelessly in the dark regarding the
      words in question.

    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dat was an extry. One ob de lady man'gers, Miss Caxton, teached us de
      cookin'. She was a lubly lady&mdash;sich a kind face, and sich daisy gray
      haar, and allers so jolly. She came twic't a week, case she was dat fond
      ob cookin' and liked chillens. She ses black skins didn't make no
      difference. One ob dese days I'se gwine to write down for yer all de
      dishes what she teached how to cook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so the first meal aboard the lighter fared on, and before it was over
      Larry made up his mind that as soon as he could afford it he would send
      five dollars to the orphan asylum and a letter besides, in which he would
      warmly express his approval of an institution that sent its little waifs
      out into the world so well equipped for rendering valuable service.

      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;ABOARD THE LIGHTER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t took such a very
      little while for Courage to feel perfectly contented and at home on the
      boat, that she was more than half inclined to take herself to task for a
      state of things which would seem to imply disloyalty to Mary Duff. As for
      Sylvia, she felt at home from the very first minute, and was constantly
      brimming over with delight. Nor was Larry far below the general level of
      happiness, for work seemed almost play with Courage ever at his side. As
      for Larry's boy, Dick, of a naturally mournful turn of mind, he too seemed
      carried along, quite in spite of himself, on the tide of prevailing high
      spirits. On more than one occasion he was known to laugh outright at some
      of Sylvia's remarkable performances, though always, it must be confessed,
      in deprecatory fashion, as though conscious of a perceptible loss of
      dignity. And who would not have been happy in that free, independent life
      they were leading! To be sure, there were discomforts. Sometimes, when the
      lighter was tied to a steaming Wharf all day, the sun would beat
      mercilessly down upon them, but then they could always look forward to the
      cool evening-out upon the water; and so happily it seemed to be in
      everything&mdash;a hundred delights to offset each discomfort. Even for
      Larry and Dick, when work was hardest and weather warmest, there was a
      sure prospect of the yellow pitcher of iced tea, which Courage never
      failed to bring midway in the long morning, and then at the end of the day
      the leisurely, comfortable dinner, for they were quite aristocratic in
      their tastes, this little boat's company.
    </p>

      <a href="images/0057.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      No noon dinner for them, with Larry in workaday clothes and the stove in
      the tiny kitchen piping its hottest at precisely the hour when its
      services could best be dispensed with, but a leisurely seven-o'clock
      dinner, with the lighter anchored off shore, and when, as a rule, Dick
      also had had time to &ldquo;tidy up,&rdquo; and could share the meal with them. And in
      this, you see, they were not aristocratic at all. Even little black Sylvia
      had a seat at one side of the table, which she occupied as continuously as
      her culinary duties would admit.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, when Larry stood talking to a friend on the wharf, Courage and
      Sylvia overheard him say, &ldquo;They're a darned competent little pair, I can
      tell you.&rdquo; Now, of course, this was rather questionable English for a
      respectable old man like Larry, but he intended it for the highest sort of
      praise, and the children could hardly help being pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Larry oughtn't to use such words,&rdquo; said Courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But den I specs he only mean dat we jes' knows how to do tings,&rdquo; said
      Sylvia apologetically; and as that was exactly what Larry did mean, we
      must forgive him the over-expressive word; besides they were, in point of
      fact, the most competent pair imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early every morning, when near the city, Dick would bring the lighter
      alongside a wharf, and Courage and Sylvia would set off for the nearest
      market, Sylvia carrying a basket, and always wearing a square of bright
      plaid gingham knotted round her head. There was no remembrance for her of
      father or of mother, or of much that would have proved dear to her warm
      little heart, but tucked away in a corner of her memory were faint
      recollections of a Southern fish market, with the red snapper sparkling in
      the morning sunlight, and the old mammies, in bandana turbans, busy about
      their master's marketing; and as though to make the best of this shadowy
      recollection, Sylvia insisted upon the turban accompaniment to the basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0012" id="linkimage-0012"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0060.jpg" alt="0060 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0060.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Then, after the marketing, came the early breakfast; and after that, for
      Courage, the many nameless duties of every housekeeper, whether big or
      little; and for Sylvia the homelier tasks of daily recurrence; but
      fortunately she did not deem them homely. Why should she, when pretty Miss
      Sylvester, as perfect a lady as could be, herself had taught her how to do
      them, every one? Nor was this work, so dignified by the manner and method
      of teaching, performed in silence. Every household task had its
      appropriate little song, and the occasions were rare on which Sylvia did
      not make use of them.=
    </p>
    <p>
      ``"Washing dishes, washing dishes, suds are hot, suds are hot,
    </p>
    <p>
      ``Work away briskly, work away briskly, do not stop, do not stop,"=
    </p>
    <p>
      was the refrain that would greet the ear first thing after breakfast,
      followed by=
    </p>
    <p>
      ```"First the glasses, rinse them well, rinse them well,
    </p>
    <p>
      ```If you do them nicely, all can tell, all can tell,"=
    </p>
    <p>
      and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after everything had been gotten into &ldquo;ship-shape&rdquo; condition, came
      the mending, of which there seemed to be an unending supply. Tarry and
      Dick were certainly very hard on their clothes, and when, once a week,
      Dick brought the heaping basketful aboard from the washer-woman, who lived
      at the Battery, Courage and Sylvia knew that needles and thimbles would
      need to be brought into active requisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in odd hours, there was studying and reading, and whenever they
      could manage it, a little visit to be paid to Mary Duff. In addition to
      all this, Courage had taken upon herself one other duty, for big,
      fifteen-year-old Dick did not so much as know his letters. He one day
      blushingly confessed the fact to Courage, who indeed had long suspected
      it, with tears in his honest blue eyes. Dick's mother&mdash;for that is
      what she was, though most unworthy of the name&mdash;had shoved him out of
      the place he called home when he was just a mere slip of a lad, and since
      then it had been all he could manage simply to make a living for himself,
      with never a moment for schooling. But a happier day had dawned. No sooner
      was Courage assured of his benighted condition than she won his
      everlasting gratitude by setting about to mend it. Their first need, of
      course, was a primer, and they immediately found one ready to the hand, or
      rather to the <i>eye</i>, for it could not be treated after the fashion of
      ordinary primers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were only seven letters in it, five capitals and two small ones, and
      the large letters were fully ten feet high. It did not even commence with
      an A, but C came first, and then R; then another R, followed by a little o
      and a a little f; and after that a large N and a large J. Indeed, C. R. R.
      of N. J. was all there was to it, for the letters were painted on a depot
      roof that happened to be in full sight on the evening when Dick commenced
      his lessons. And so Dick finally mastered the entire alphabet by the aid
      of the great signs in the harbor, and do you think they ever rendered half
      such worthy service?
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, was the story of the uneventful days as they dawned one after
      the other, until at last May yielding place to June, and June to July,
      Saturday, the first day of August, came in by the calendar, ran through
      its midsummer hours, and then sank to rest in the cradle of a wonderful
      sunset. It was such a sunset as sometimes glorifies the bay and the river,
      and will not be overlooked. Long rays of gold and crimson shot athwart
      even the narrowest and darkest cross streets of the city, compelling every
      one who had eyes to see and feet to walk upon to come out and enjoy its
      beauty; while a blaze of light, falling full upon the myriad windows of
      Brooklyn Heights, suggested the marvellous golden city of the Revelation.
      Full in the wake of all this glory, and just to the southeast of Bedloe's
      Island, Larry had moored the lighter. It was a favorite anchorage with all
      the little boat's company.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0064.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Statue of Liberty&rdquo;, standing out so grandly against the western sky,
      and with the light of her torch shining down all night upon them, seemed
      always a veritable friend and protector.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-morrow, perhaps, they would touch at Staten Island, and locking the
      cabin, &ldquo;all hands&rdquo; repair to a little church they loved well at New
      Brighton; or, should it prove a very warm day, they might have a little
      service of their own on board instead, sailing quite past the church and
      as far down the bay as the Bell Buoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for the present there was nothing to be done but watch the sun set, so
      they sat together in the lee of the cabin, silently thinking their own
      thoughts as the sun went down. Courage had on the blue coat and hat, and
      from the wistful look in her eyes, might easily have been thinking of Miss
      Julia. Larry sat looking at Courage more, perhaps, than at the sunset, and
      his face was grave and sad. Courage had noticed that it had often been so
      of late, and wondered what could be the trouble. After awhile Larry slowly
      strolled off by himself to the bow of the boat, and Courage gazed
      anxiously after him; then, turning to Dick, she said with a sigh, &ldquo;We had
      better have a lesson now, Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; answered Dick, always glad of the chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too dark for a book,&rdquo; Courage added, &ldquo;but there's a good sign;&rdquo;
       whereupon Dick set himself to master two large-lettered words over on the
      Jersey shore, one of which looked rather formidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begin with the last word, Dick. You've had it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-o-c-k&mdash;dock, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now the first word. Try to make it out yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick shrugged his shoulders, for it was rather a jump to a word of three
      syllables, but success at last crowned his efforts. &ldquo;National Docks!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, with the delight of unaided discovery, feeling as though the
      attainment had added a good square inch to his height. Then came another
      sign with the one word Storage, but that was easy, for &ldquo;Prentice Stores&rdquo;
       had been achieved the day before off the Brooklyn warehouses, and it was
      only a step from one word to the other. Finally, when there were no new
      signs to conquer, Courage began a sort of review, from memory, of all they
      had been over. In the midst of it Sylvia suddenly ran to the side of the
      boat, arched one black hand over her eyes that she might see the more
      clearly, and then flew back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat horrid statue boy is comin',&rdquo; she cried excitedly; &ldquo;I thought it
      looked like him, an' if onct he gets a foot on dis boat he'll keep comin',
      he will; I knowed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see that you can help it, though,&rdquo; laughed Courage; &ldquo;you can't
      tell him that we just don't want to have anything to do with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia looked perplexed, but only for a moment; then, indulging in one of
      those remarkable pirouettes with which she was accustomed to announce the
      advent of a happy thought, she ran back again to the boat's edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile every dip of the oars was bringing the objectionable boy nearer,
      and a horrid boy he was, if one may be permitted to speak quite honestly.
      Dick and Sylvia had made his undesirable acquaintance one evening when
      Larry had sent them to the island to learn the right time. He was the son
      of one of the men employed to care for the statue, and was, alas! every
      whit as disagreeable in manners as in looks, which is not to put the case
      mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Miss Woolly-head!&rdquo; he called, bringing his boat to the lighter's
      side, and tossing a rope aboard, which Miss Woolly-head was supposed to
      catch, but didn't, so that the boat veered off again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the name of your little missus?&rdquo; called the boy, apparently not in
      the least nonplussed by his rather chilling reception. The knowledge that
      Sylvia had a little &ldquo;missus&rdquo; had been obtained by means of several leading
      questions which had characterized the young gentleman's first interview
      with Sylvia and Dick, and which they had regarded as the very epitome of
      rudeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dis yere lighter is called for my missus,&rdquo; said Sylvia, &ldquo;so you kin jes'
      read her name dere on de do' plate,&rdquo; pointing to the lettering at the bow
      of the boat, &ldquo;an den again, mebbe you can't,&rdquo; she chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It looked as though the statue boy &ldquo;couldn't,&rdquo; for he did not so much as
      glance toward the bow, as he added, &ldquo;Well, it's your missus I want to see,
      and not you, you little black pickaninny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat's all right, sah,&rdquo; and Sylvia folded her arms aggressively, &ldquo;but you
      can't see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't she in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she's in, but she begs to be excuged.&rdquo; This last in the most
      impressive manner possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick and Courage, who were sitting just out of sight, looked at each other
      and almost laughed outright. What remarkable phrases Sylvia seemed always
      to have at her tongue's end! Indeed, Dick did not know at all what was
      meant by the fine phrase, but fortunately the statue boy did&mdash;that is
      after a moment or two of reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she don't want to see me,&rdquo; he said, sullenly adjusting his oars with
      considerable more noise than was necessary; &ldquo;well, no more then do I want
      to see her. I ain't no mind to stay where I ain't wanted, but I reckon
      it's the last time you'll be 'lowed to anchor your old scow over the line
      without there being a row about it,&rdquo; and with this parting rejoinder their
      would-be caller beat a welcome retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sylvia, how did you happen to think to say that?&rdquo; laughed Courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, dat's what you must allers say when anybody calls. Dey teached it in
      a game in de Kitchen Garden. We all stood up in a ring, an' a girl came
      an' knocked on yer back and axed, 'Is Mis' Brown to home?' Den you turn
      roun' an' say, 'Mis' Brown are to home, but begs to be excuged,' and den
      it was yer turn to be de caller and knock on some other girl's back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sylvia, if Mrs. Brown wanted to see the caller what would you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' prezachly recommember. I mos'ly likes de excuged one de bes'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Dick made his way to Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know we were anchored inside the line?&rdquo; he said. Larry stood up
      to take his bearings. &ldquo;Why, so we are,&rdquo; with evident annoyance, for Larry
      prided himself on his observance of harbor rules.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I guess we've done it before,&rdquo; added Dick; &ldquo;the boy from the island
      there said it would be the last time we'd be 'lowed to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it ought to be,&rdquo; for Larry was thoroughly out of patience with
      himself; &ldquo;we'll show 'em we meant to obey orders anyway. Let go her
      anchor, Dick,&rdquo; and then in a moment the big sail, that had been furled for
      the night, was spread to the wind once more, and the Courage Masterson was
      running out upon the bay, that she might swing in again and anchor at the
      proper distance from the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's up, I wonder,&rdquo; said Sylvia, starting to her feet when she felt the
      lighter in motion. &ldquo;Oh, I know; Dick's told Larry we were anchored too
      near,&rdquo; and she settled down again in the most comfortable position
      imaginable, on the rug beside Courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Sylvia, what is your other name?&rdquo; Courage asked after a little
      pause; &ldquo;I've been meaning to ask you this ever so long. I think it was on
      the medal, but I do not remember it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvester,&rdquo; said Sylvia complacently, smoothing out her gingham apron.
      &ldquo;Sylvy Sylvester; dose two names hitch togedder putty tol'ble, don't dey,
      Miss Courage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they go beautifully together; that's why you're named Sylvia, of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia shook her head. &ldquo;No, dat's why I'se named Sylvester.&rdquo; Courage
      looked puzzled. &ldquo;I'se named arter Miss Sylvester, one ob de Kitchen Garden
      ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sylvia, children can only have their first names given to them;
      they're born to their last names.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dis chile wa'nt, Miss Courage; leastways nobody didn't know at de 'sylum
      what name I was bawn to, cep'n jes' Sylvy, so I picked mine out mysel'.
      One day I went to Miss Sylvester an' sez, kind o' mischievous, 'How do yer
      like yer namesake?' 'Ain't got none, Sylvy,' sez she. 'Yes you hab,' I
      done told her. 'It's ten year old an' its black, but I hope yer don't
      mind, 'case it's me.' An' she didn't mind a bit, jes' as I knowed she
      wouldn't, and she sez some beautiful 'things 'bout as I mus' 'allers be a
      honor to the name, an' arter dat she gimme two books, wid Sylvy Sylvester
      wrote into 'em, from her everlastin' friend an' well-wisher, Mary
      Sylvester. Youse done seen dose two books on my table, Miss Courage. One's
      called&mdash;&rdquo; but the sentence was not finished. Something happened just
      then that made both children spring to their feet and hold their breath
      for fear of what was coming. A few minutes before they had noticed that
      one of the large Sandy Hook boats seemed to be bearing down upon them, and
      that to all appearances they were directly in her track. But their faith
      in Larry was supreme. He would surely manage to get out of the way in
      time, but alas! they were mistaken, for the great boat came looming up
      like a mountain beside them, and in another second there was a deafening,
      heart-sickening crash, and splintering of timbers. Sylvia gave one
      piercing, terrified scream, while she and Courage clung as for their lives
      to the coping of the cabin roof. And indeed it was a terrible moment. The
      force of the collision sent the lighter careening so much to one side that
      it seemed for an instant hopeless that she could possibly right herself;
      and oh! low frightful to go down, down into that cruel dark water; but
      then in another instant she swung violently to the other side, and they
      knew that the danger of capsizing was over, though the boat was still
      rocking like a cradle. Then they saw the captain of the St. Johns come
      hurrying to the deck-rail, and heard him angrily call out, &ldquo;Man alive
      there, are you drunk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not drunk,&rdquo; Larry answered, from where he stood, pale and
      trembling, leaning heavily against the tiller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not drunk? Then you're too green a hand to be minding a helm in salt
      water. Only for our reversed engines you'd not have a shingle under you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Larry made no reply; Courage, still holding Sylvia by the hand, looked
      daggers at the man. To think of any one daring to speak like that to good
      old Larry. Of course he was not the one to blame, and but that the two
      boats were fast drifting apart, she would then and there have told the St.
      Johns' captain what she thought of him. Just at this moment Courage
      noticed a lady and gentleman on the rear deck of the steamer. She saw the
      lady give a start of surprise and speak hurriedly to the gentleman, who
      immediately called in as loud a voice as he could command, &ldquo;What is your
      name, little girl? Tell me quickly.&rdquo; He meant Courage, and Courage knew
      that he did; but Sylvia not so understanding it, a confusion of sounds
      smote the air, of which a shrill little Syl was all that could by any
      chance be distinguished; then in a second they were all hopelessly out of
      hearing of each other, and the big boat steamed on to her pier, none the
      worse for the encounter save for a great ugly scar on her white-painted
      bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas! for Larry's lighter. Although she was still sound as a nut below
      the water's edge, above it she looked as though a cyclone had struck her.
      And so it was a subdued though a thankful little company that stowed
      themselves away in their berths an hour or so later, after the boat had
      again been brought to anchor, and they had had time to talk everything
      over. But there was one pillow that lay unpressed that night. With his
      mind full of anxiety, bed was out of the question for Larry, and for hours
      he slowly paced the deck; at least, it seemed hours to Courage, as she lay
      awake in her little state-room, counting his steps as he went up and down,
      until she knew precisely at just what number he would turn. She had first
      tried very hard to go to sleep. She had listened to the water quietly
      lapping the boat's side, imagining it a lullaby, but the lullaby proved
      ineffectual. At last she pulled back the curtain from the little window
      over her berth, so that the light from the statue might stream in upon
      her, entertaining a childish notion that she might perhaps sort of blink
      herself to sleep; but all in vain. Finally she heard Larry come into the
      cabin and apparently stop there. Why didn't he go on into his state-room,
      she wondered. When she could stand it no longer, she put on her wrapper
      and slippers, and stole out into the cabin. The little room, lighted by
      Liberty's torch, was bright as her own, and Larry sat at the table, his
      head bowed upon his folded arms. Courage went close to him, and putting
      out one little hand, began softly to stroke his gray hair. Larry did not
      start as she touched him, so she knew he must have heard her coming.

      <a href="images/0076.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you feel so very sorry about the lighter, Larry?&rdquo; she asked anxiously;
      &ldquo;will it take such a great lot of money to mend it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Larry did not raise his head, but it seemed to Courage that a sob, as real
      as any child's, shook his strong frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Larry, speak to me,&rdquo; Courage pleaded, and feeling her two hands
      against his face, Larry suffered her to lift it up. Yes, there were tears
      in his eyes. Courage saw them and looked right away&mdash;even to the
      child there was something sacred in a strong man's tears&mdash;but she
      slipped on to his knee, nestled her head on his shoulder, and then said,
      in the tenderest little voice, &ldquo;It isn't just the accident, is it, Larry?
      Something's been troubling you this long while. Please tell me what it is.
      Don't forget about my name being Courage, and that p'r'aps I can help
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words fell very sweetly upon Larry's ear, and he drew her closer to
      him, but she could feel him slowly move his head from side to side, as
      though it were hopeless to look for help from any quarter. Suddenly a
      dreadful possibility flashed itself across her mind, and sitting upright,
      she said excitedly, &ldquo;You're not going to die, Larry? Say it isn't <i>that</i>,
      quick, Larry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, darling, it isn't that,&rdquo; Larry hastened to answer, deeply touched by
      the agony in her voice, &ldquo;but it's almost worse than dying; I'm going&mdash;&rdquo;
       and then the word failed him, and he passed his hand significantly across
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not <i>blind</i>, Larry?&rdquo; yet instantly recalling, as she spoke, many a
      little incident that confirmed her fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, blind, Courage; that's the way it happened to-night. It was all my
      fault. I couldn't rightly see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Larry, hardly any one could see, it was getting so dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage, darling,&rdquo; Larry said tenderly, &ldquo;it's been getting dark for me
      for a year. I shall never sail a boat again. They told me in the spring
      that I wasn't fit for it, but then I found you'd set your heart on being
      on the water with me, and so, with Dick's eyes to help, I thought I could
      manage just for the summer; but it's all over now, and it's plain enough
      that I've got to give in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so Larry has done all this for her. At first Courage cannot speak, but
      at last she contrives to say, in a tearful, trembling voice, &ldquo;Try not to
      mind, Larry. If you'll only let me take care of you, it won't matter at
      all whether we live on the water or not. I can be happy any-where with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Larry is in no small degree comforted. How could it be otherwise with
      that loyal child-heart standing up to him so bravely in his trial! And
      finally he tells Courage of a plan, that has come into his mind, to spend
      the remainder of the summer in the queerest little place that ever was
      heard of, and he proceeds to describe the little place to her. Courage is
      delighted with the scheme, and they talk quietly about it for ever so
      long, till after awhile, right in the midst of a sentence, Courage drops
      asleep on Larry's shoulder. Then, rather than disturb her, Larry sits
      perfectly motionless, and at last the noble gray head, drooping lower and
      lower, rests against the red-brown curls, and Larry is also asleep, while
      across them both slants a band of marvellous light from the torch of the
      island statue.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;&ldquo;THE QUEEREST LITTLE PLACE.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t's mos' as nice
      as de boat, an' eber so much like it,&rdquo; said Sylvia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, most as nice,&rdquo; Courage conceded, &ldquo;and the next best thing for a man
      like Larry, who's lived all his life on the water. It looks a sight better
      than when we came, doesn't it? But hush! Look, Sylvia; isn't that a bite?
      Have the net ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Sylvia had the net ready, and in another second a great sprawling crab
      was landed in the boat beside them, for you must know that mistress and
      maid are out crabbing on the South Shrewsbury, and are meeting with much
      better luck than is generally experienced in midsummer weather. Directly
      over their heads is the queer little place that has recently become their
      home. That chink there is in the floor of Sylvia's carpetless room, and
      those wisps of straw are sticking through from Bruce's kennel. To be sure,
      you have heard nothing of that young gentleman since the day when Courage
      dried her tears on his coat, but that is only because there have been more
      important things to tell about. He has, however, been behaving in the most
      exemplary manner all the while, and has been, as always, Larry's constant
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the queer little place, you have probably never seen anything at
      all like it, unless, as is possible, you have chanced to see this very
      little place itself. It is a house, of course, but wholly unlike other
      houses. It has several rooms, but they are all strung along in a row, and
      boasts neither attic nor cellar. There is water under it and water on
      every side of it; in short, it is on the drawbridge that spans the river
      between Port-au-Peck and Town Neck, and is what I presume may be called a
      draw-house. Of the many bridges spanning the inlets threading all that
      region of sea-board country, this South Shrewsbury Bridge is by far the
      longest, and therefore the most pretentious.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0016" id="linkimage-0016"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0081.jpg" alt="0081 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0081.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The draw, to accommodate the channel of the river, has been placed near
      the southern end, while at either end of it on the main bridge are gates
      that swing to for the protection of teams when the draw itself is open.
      The house also stretches its length along the main bridge toward its
      southern end.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the day when the ice goes out of the river to the day when it locks
      it in again it is David Starr's home, and David is Larry Starr's brother.
      David's wife has been dead these many years; all his children are married
      and settled; and David, not wishing, as he says, &ldquo;to be beholden to ony of
      'em,&rdquo; minds the South Shrewsbury draw. For nine months or thereabouts he
      stays on the bridge, and then, while the river is ice-bound, retreats to a
      little house on the main-land, living quite by himself all the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is the place to which Larry has come with Courage and Sylvia, and
      lonely old David is glad enough to see them, particularly as Larry
      proposes to pay a snug little sum weekly, by way of board.
    </p>
    <p>
      What they will do when cold weather sets in Larry has not yet decided; he
      fully expects, however, to send Courage to school somewhere in the city,
      if it take half his savings to do it; but for Larry himself, alas! the
      darkness is settling down more and more surely. Meantime, Courage and
      Sylvia do all in their power to cheer him, and everybody, Larry included,
      tries hard not to think of the on-coming blindness. As for Larry's
      cabin-boy, Dick, he could not, unfortunately, be included in this new
      plan, but Courage, at Larry's dictation, wrote him a most promising sort
      of a reference, and one which succeeded in obtaining him just as promising
      a situation. And there was one other important matter attended to before
      they all took final leave of Dick and the dear old lighter. Larry painted
      out her name from the bow with the blackest of black paint. He would sell
      his boat if he must, but the Courage Masterson, never!
    </p>
    <p>
      But while I have been telling you all this, Courage and Sylvia, their
      crabbing concluded, have tied their boat to the shore, and with a
      well-filled basket swinging between them, are coming down the bridge. Over
      against the house Larry sits in the sunshine, smoking his pipe, that is
      now more of a comfort than ever, and with Bruce at his feet. He hears the
      children and knows their tread almost the instant they set foot on the
      roadway, his good old ears seeming kindly bent on doing double service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any luck?&rdquo; he calls out, as soon as he reckons them within speaking
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, twelve big ones,&rdquo; answers Sylvia; &ldquo;but Lor'! Ise don' know nuffin
      'bout how to cook things what's alive to start with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;David'll tell you how to manage,&rdquo; laughs Larry, and just then a carriage,
      crossing over the bridge, comes close upon them. Courage instinctively
      glances over her shoulder, and straightway dropping her end of the basket,
      cries out, with what little remaining breath surprise has left her, &ldquo;Why,
      Miss Julia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Courage, dear, <i>where</i> did you come from?&rdquo; and instantly the
      phaeton is brought to a standstill, and Courage bounds into it, and then
      there is the report of a kiss loud enough to have started any save the
      most discriminating of ponies on the wildest of gallops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought you were to be on a boat all summer!&rdquo; exclaims Miss Julia
      the next minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I was, but&mdash;&rdquo; and then, feeling that there is something even
      more important than an immediate explanation, Courage bounds out of the
      carriage again, that she may lead Larry to Miss Julia, and they of course
      shake hands very heartily, as two people should who have heard so much of
      each other. Then Larry and Courage between them explain matters, and Miss
      Julia in turn tells of her summer home, but a mile away on the Rumson
      Road, and of how very often she drives over the Shrewsbury Draw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile poor Sylvia has been having an anxious time of it. When Courage
      so unceremoniously dropped her end of the basket, several of the crabs
      went scrawling out of it, and, as you know, there is nothing more lively
      than a hard-shell crab, struggling with all its might to regain its native
      element. But with the aid of Miss Julia's man, who has sprung down from
      the rumble to help her, Sylvia does succeed in recapturing four of the
      runaways, not, alas! however, before two beauties have succeeded in
      gaining the edge of the bridge, and in plumping themselves back into the
      water with a splash that must have consumed with envy the hearts of their
      less fortunate fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last it is time for Sylvia to be introduced, and, as usual, her beaming
      face expresses her satisfaction. Then there is a general chatting for a
      little while longer, in which each bears a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how pretty you have made it all!&rdquo; says Miss Julia, taking up the
      reins, preparatory to driving on. &ldquo;I never should have known the place,
      with the dainty dimity curtains at the windows and these starch boxes full
      of plants along the rail here; such nice old-fashioned plants, too&mdash;geraniums
      and lemon verbena and that little low plant with the funny name&mdash;oh,
      yes, I remember&mdash;portulaca. How long has it taken you to work such a
      transformation, Courage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a week, Miss Julia. We came down last Monday; but then Sylvia and I
      have worked pretty hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you have. You're a pair of regular wonder-working fairies, you
      and your faithful Sylvia. And now I must say good-bye, but not until Larry
      promises that you shall come, both of you, and spend day after to-morrow
      with me. I will send John down for you, with the ponies, bright and early,
      and we'll have such a day of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Larry promised, Miss Julia drove on, and the children looked a delight
      which was, in very truth, unspeakable.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>eally, I believe
      it's nicer than being on the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; responded Sylvia, with a supreme faith in any assertion that
      Courage might choose to make; &ldquo;but why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we have the fun of living out on the water, and Miss Julia
      besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, to be sure!&rdquo; half ashamed to have ventured so obvious a
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Julia besides! No one could imagine what those three little words
      meant to Courage. It was a delight in itself simply to waken in the
      morning, and know that before night Miss Julia would probably come riding
      over on her beautiful &ldquo;Rex&rdquo; or driving the gray ponies, or if not to-day,
      then to-morrow. Whenever she came she would stop for a chat, and more
      likely than not bring with her some little gift from the wonderful place
      on the Rumson&mdash;a plant from the greenhouse, a golden roll of
      delicious butter, or just a beautiful flower or two that her own hands had
      picked in the garden. <a name="linkimage-0017" id="linkimage-0017"> </a>

    <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">

    </div>
    <p>
      And so the summer was crowned for Courage by the happy accident of
      nearness to Miss Julia, and the only sad moments were when, now and then,
      a great longing for her father surged over her, or when the realization of
      Larry's ever-increasing blindness pressed heavily down upon even her
      buoyant spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for life on the draw, the days slipped by as uneventfully as on the
      lighter, though no doubt they were more monotonous. There were no morning
      trips through the busy streets to market (David had all their supplies
      sent over from Red Bank), and nothing, of course, of the ever-changing
      life of the harbor; but the children were more than contented. Sylvia was
      never so happy as when at work, and somehow or other there always seemed
      to be plenty of work for the little black hands to do. But, it must be
      confessed, there were times when Courage did find the days rather dull&mdash;times
      when she did not feel quite like reading or studying, and when she could
      think of nothing that needed to be done. There was one recreation,
      however, that always served to add a zest to the quietest sort of a day.
      Every clear afternoon, somewhere between four and six o'clock, she would
      don the pretty blue hat, and when it was anywise cool enough the blue
      coat, too&mdash;for she loved to wear it&mdash;and then go out and perch
      herself safely somewhere on the top of the bridge rail and with her back
      to the sun, should he happen to be shining. Then in a little while some of
      her friends, out for their afternoon drive, would be pretty sure to come
      crossing the bridge, and though possibly lacking the time to stop for a
      chat, would at least exchange a few cheery words as they perforce walked
      their horses over the draw. I say some of her friends, for already there
      were many of them, for people could hardly escape noticing the pretty
      little house and the kind-faced, halfblind old man sitting in the
      door-way, or failing these, the little girl in the handsome blue coat and
      hat. Some had either guessed or found out the meaning of the black bow on
      the sleeve, and ever afterward seemed to regard her with an interest close
      bordering on downright affection. Indeed, in one way and another, the
      household on the draw became known far and wide, and strangers sometimes
      driving that way for no other reason than to see the beautiful little girl
      with the remarkable name, were disappointed enough if they did not chance
      to come across her; but of this far-reaching notoriety Courage fortunately
      never so much as dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the days fared on much as I have described until there came an
      evening when something happened. It was an evening early in October, and
      our little party sitting down to their six o'clock supper were every one
      in a particularly happy frame of mind. The sun had gone down in a blaze of
      gold and crimson, and the river, which is wide enough below the bridge to
      be dignified as a bay, lay like a mirror reflecting the marvellous color.
      Later, when the twilight was fusing all the varying shades into a fleecy,
      wondrously tinted gray; a brisk little breeze strode up from the west, and
      instantly the water rose in myriad tiny waves to meet it, and each wave
      donned a &ldquo;white-cap,&rdquo; as in honor of its coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low down on the horizon the veriest thread of a new moon was paying court
      to the evening star, that was also near its setting, but both still shone
      out with more than common brilliancy through the early evening air. Here,
      then, was one cause for the generally happy feeling, and another, no
      doubt, lay in the all-pervading cheeriness of the little home. Humble and
      small it was, to be sure, but there was comfort, and plenty of it, on
      every side&mdash;comfort in the mere sight of the daintily set table;
      comfort of a very substantial kind in the contents of the shining teapot,
      in the scrambled eggs sizzling away in a chafing-dish, which Sylvia had
      cleverly concocted, and, above all, in the aroma, as well as in the taste,
      of the deliciously browned toast. People who chanced to come driving over
      glanced in at the cosey, lamp-lighted table, caught a whiff of the savory
      odors, and then the moment they were off the draw urged on their horses in
      elusive hope of finding something as inviting at home. During the progress
      of the meal, and while Sylvia, who was an inimitable little mimic, was
      giving a lisping impersonation of one of the teachers at the Asylum, a
      carriage rolled rapidly by, and some one called, &ldquo;Hello there, Courage!&rdquo;
       Quickly recognizing the voice, Courage rushed out-of-doors, almost
      upsetting the table in her eagerness, but even then Miss Julia was a long
      way past, having actually trotted her ponies right over the draw itself in
      most unprecedented fashion. This was a grave offence in David's eyes, and
      Courage, retaking her seat at the table, wondered what he would have to
      say about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Julia must have been in a great hurry,&rdquo; she ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a ten-dollar hurry,&rdquo; growled David.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you won't fine her!&rdquo; Courage exclaimed, alarmed at the mere thought
      of anything so ungracious; &ldquo;she just couldn't have been thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, we'll just teach her how to think;&rdquo; but Sylvia, quite sure
      that she detected a lack of determination in David's tone, said
      complacently, &ldquo;Neber you fear, Miss Courage. Mr. David don' sure nuff mean
      what he sez, I reckon,&rdquo; whereupon Mr. David shook his head, as much as to
      say, &ldquo;Well, he rather guessed he did,&rdquo; but Courage saw with relief that
      there really was nothing to fear. After supper Larry and David took a turn
      on the bridge while the table was being cleared, and then coming back to
      the little living-room, Courage read aloud for an hour from one of Sylvia
      Sylvester's namesake books. It chanced to be the incomparable story of
      &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland,&rdquo; and David and Larry were as charmed as the little
      folk themselves. At nine o'clock the book was laid away and Larry went
      directly to bed. Courage and Sylvia hurried into coats and hats for a run
      in the bracing night air, and David, stopping first to light his pipe,
      followed them out onto the bridge. All three found to their surprise that
      the sky had grown suddenly lowering and overcast, while the breeze of the
      twilight was fast stiffening to a vigorous west wind.

    <p>
      &ldquo;We're in for a blow, I'm thinkin',&rdquo; said David, looking down-river, with
      the children standing beside him, &ldquo;and, bless me! there isn't a star to be
      seen. Who'd a-thought it after that sunset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courage, seeing something in the distance, paid no attention to this last
      remark. &ldquo;Mr. David, what's that?&rdquo; she exclaimed, pointing in the direction
      in which she had been gazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure it looks like a sail, Courage. Can it be that they're wantin' to get
      through, I wonder? What's a boat out for this time o' night, anyhow?&rdquo; Then
      for several minutes all was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Sylvia at last; &ldquo;doesn't that sound like rowing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes it do,&rdquo; said David, after listening intently, his hand to his ear. &ldquo;I
      thought it didn't 'pear just like a sail-boat; howsomever, there's a white
      thing dangling to it that looks&mdash;&rdquo; but here David was interrupted by
      a coarse voice calling out, &ldquo;Hello there! Open the draw, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello there!&rdquo; David answered; &ldquo;but what'll I open it for? Ye're rowin',
      aren't ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we're rowing to gain time, but there's a sail to the boat as plain
      as daylight, isn't there? Now hurry, man alive, and do as you're told;
      we've sprung aleak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sprung aleak! Then ye're fools not to make straight for the shore,&rdquo;
       reasoned David.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's our lookout; but for land's sake! open the draw, instead of
      standing there talking all night,&rdquo; and David, realizing that there may be
      danger for the men in longer parleying, puts his hand to the lever,
      hurriedly dispatching the children to close the gates at either end; and
      away they fly, eager to render a service often required of them when there
      was need for special expedition. Indeed, one can but wonder how David
      sometimes managed when alone, and a boat tacking against the wind had need
      to make the draw at precisely the right moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to-night it happens that he is in too great haste, and while yet
      several yards from the gate, Courage, with horror, feels the draw
      beginning to move under her. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she calls back to David, but her
      voice is weak with fear, and her feet seemed weighted. Oh, if she cannot
      reach the end in time to make the main bridge and close the gate, and some
      one should come driving on in the darkness, never seeing that the draw was
      open! At last she is at the edge, but only the tenth of a second more and
      it will be too late to jump. Shall she try it? It will be taking a
      dreadful risk. She may land right against the rail, be thrown back into
      the water, and no one know in time to hasten to her rescue. She hesitates.
      <i>No</i>&mdash;and then <i>yes</i>, for an instantly deciding thought has
      come to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The draw swings clear of the bridge. The men in the boat, grumbling at
      everything, paddled clumsily through, while over the other gate, reached
      barely in time, Sylvia hangs breathless and trembling. At the same moment
      with Courage, she, too, felt the draw begin to move, but luckily chanced
      to be nearer her goal. Meanwhile, where is Courage? Not in the water,
      thank God, but prone upon the bridge above it, lying just where she fell
      when, as she jumped, the rail of the draw struck her feet and threw her
      roughly down upon it. She feels terribly jarred and bruised, and tries in
      vain to lift herself up. But, hark! is that the sound of horses on the
      road? Yes, surely, and they are coming nearer; and now they are on the
      bridge, and the gate&mdash;the gate is open. With one superhuman effort
      she struggles to her feet, reaches out for it, and swings it to. Then,
      leaning heavily against the rail, she utters one shrill, inarticulate
      scream. There is another scream almost as shrill in answer, and instantly
      a pair of ponies, brought to an alarmingly sudden standstill, rear high in
      the air beside her, and Courage, unable to stand another moment, drops in
      a limp little heap to the flooring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, darling Courage!&rdquo; whispers some one close bending above her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dear</i> Miss Julia,&rdquo; and a little hand all of a tremble gropes for
      Miss Julia's face in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The draw swings back into place, and Sylvia is on it in a flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you didn't gib us 'nough time,&rdquo; she cries accusingly to David as she
      flies past. David instantly divines her meaning, for they both know
      Courage well enough to fear she may have run some terrible danger, and
      seizing the lantern, hanging midway in the draw, David follows Sylvia as
      fast as tottering limbs will carry him. What a sickening sensation sweeps
      over him as the horses loom up in the darkness and he sees a group of
      people crowding about something hung on the bridge!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0019" id="linkimage-0019"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0099.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She isn't deaded! she isn't deaded!&rdquo; Sylvia joyfully calls out, and that
      moment the light from the lantern falls athwart a prostrate little figure
      in the midst of the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can get up now&rdquo; are the words that meet David's ear, and an
      answering &ldquo;God be praised!&rdquo; escapes from his quivering lips. Then some one
      turns the heads of the quieted horses, and two ladies, one on either side
      of Courage, help her back to the house. Larry, who has heard the
      commotion, succeeds in getting dressed and out to the door just as the
      little party reach it. He starts alarmed and surprised at the sight of
      Courage, but fortunately is too blind to see the alarming stains of blood
      on her little white face, but the moment they enter the light the others
      are quick to see them. Courage is lifted into David's big rocker, and
      Larry, groping into his own room, brings a pillow for her back; Sylvia
      disappears and returns in a trice with a towel and a basin of water; Miss
      Julia, with shaking hands, measures something into a glass; the other
      lady, with a little help from Courage, removes the dust-begrimed coat, and
      then lays it very tenderly over a chair. And now the color begins to surge
      back into the little pale face. The cut under the curls, which is not
      severe enough to need a surgeon, is tightly bound, and then at last they
      all sit down to get their breath for a moment. The horses, which of course
      were none other than Miss Julia's gray ponies, are secured to a rail
      outside, and David brings a strange gentleman into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my brother, Courage,&rdquo; says Miss Julia&mdash;&ldquo;he has often heard
      me speak of you&mdash;and this lady is his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courage smiles in acknowledgment of the introduction, for, indeed, she
      does not feel equal to talking yet, and so keeps perfectly quiet,
      listening to all the others&mdash;to David's reiterated self-accusations
      for forgetting, in his haste, to make sure that the children were clear of
      the draw; to Sylvia's excited account of the way she had &ldquo;jes' ter
      scrabble&rdquo; to get over in time; to Miss Julia's explanation of how they had
      set out at that late hour, and on a sudden impulse, to pay a call down at
      Elberon, and of how, in her eagerness to spend as little time as possible
      on the road, she had forgotten to walk the ponies over the draw; and then
      to her description of her terror when the scream smote her ears, and she
      reined in her ponies so suddenly as to almost throw them over backward;
      until, at last, Courage herself feels inclined to put in a little word of
      her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you didn't hear me call at all, Mr. David?&rdquo; she asked in a low little
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never a word, darling&mdash;never a word. Oh, it's dreadful to think what
      might ha' happened, and I so careless!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right now though, Mr. David,&rdquo; Courage said comfortingly, &ldquo;but it
      was terrible to have to jump at the last moment like that. I thought I
      couldn't at first, that no team would be likely to come over so late, and
      then&mdash;oh, it's wonderful how many things you can think just in a
      moment&mdash;I remembered that Miss Julia was over the draw, and I felt I
      must try to do it,&rdquo; and Courage looked toward Miss Julia with eyes that
      said, &ldquo;There is nothing in the world I would not try to do for you,&rdquo; and
      then what did Miss Julia herself do but break right down and cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why are you crying?&rdquo; asked Courage, greatly troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I cannot help it, Courage. It was so brave to risk so much, and
      all for my sake, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I was not really brave, Miss Julia. You see&rdquo;&mdash;and as though
      fully convinced of the logic of her position&mdash;&ldquo;I think I was not
      going to do it at all till I remembered about you. And if I hadn't, and
      even if no one had happened to come on the bridge, I should have been
      ashamed of it always every time any one called me Courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you are not going to take the least credit to yourself,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Everett, Miss Julia's brother. &ldquo;Well, you certainly are a most unheard-of
      little personage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courage was not at all sure whether this was complimentary or otherwise,
      but no matter. She had not much thought or heed for anything beyond the
      fact that Miss Julia was crying, and she very much wished she wouldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Miss Julia's sister sat thinking her own thoughts with a sad,
      far-away look in her eyes. She knew that little blue coat so well, and
      this was not the first time she had come across it since, months before,
      she had sent it away, expecting never to see it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage,&rdquo; she asked at last in what seemed an opportune moment, &ldquo;were you
      not on a lighter that was run into by the St. Johns a few weeks ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; answered Courage, surprised; &ldquo;and were you the lady and the
      gentleman?&rdquo; (glancing toward Mr. Everett).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we wanted to learn your name, but you and Sylvia here both answered
      at once, so we could not make it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I thought I recognized the little blue coat you had on, and now
      that I have seen you again, I feel sure of it. I think it must have been
      given to you by Miss Julia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Courage; &ldquo;and did you know the little girl it used to
      belong to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It belonged to my own little girl, Courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your little girl? Oh, I would love to have seen her wear it, it's such
      a beautiful coat! Did she mind having it given away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage,&rdquo; said Miss Julia sadly, &ldquo;little Belle died last winter, and so
      there was no longer any need for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dat's how it was,&rdquo; said practical Sylvia, who had listened
      attentively to every word. &ldquo;We've spec'lated of 'en an' over&mdash;ain't
      we, Miss Courage?&mdash;why a jes-as-good-as-new coat was eber gib away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Sylvia!&rdquo; whispered Courage, feeling instinctively that this
      commonplace remark was untimely; and then by grace of the same beautiful
      intuition she asked gently, &ldquo;Did it make you feel very badly to see your
      little Belle's coat on a strange little girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It almost frightened me. Courage, for Belle had auburn curls, too, and
      you seemed so like her as you stood there. Then, after a moment, when I
      had had time to think, I felt pretty sure it must be Belle's own coat that
      I saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry that I happened to have it on,&rdquo; said Courage; &ldquo;I would not
      like to have seen anything of my papa's on anybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I thought,&rdquo; said Mrs. Everett, wondering that a child should so
      apparently understand every phase of a great sorrow, &ldquo;but I find I was
      mistaken,&rdquo; and Mrs. Everett, moving her chair close beside Courage, took
      her little brown hand in hers, as she added: &ldquo;More than once since that
      evening it has been on my lips to ask Miss Julia if she knew who was the
      owner of Belle's coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And more than once,&rdquo; said Miss Julia, &ldquo;it has been on my lips to tell
      without your asking, and then I feared only to start for you some train of
      sad thoughts.&rdquo; Miss Julia by this time had gotten the best of her tears,
      and stood behind Courage affectionately stroking the beautiful wavy hair,
      for both she and Mrs. Everett were longing to give expression to the
      overpowering sense of gratitude welling up within them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what the black bow is for?&rdquo; Courage asked of Mrs. Everett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was mourning for some one, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it is mourning for my papa. A little girl told me I ought to wear
      all black clothes, but Miss Julia thought not; only she just tied this bow
      on for me the last day of sewing-school, because I wanted to have
      something that would tell that I was very lonely without him. Soldiers
      wear mourning like that, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this while Larry had sat quietly on one side, his dimmed eyes resting
      proudly on Courage; but now he had something to say on his own account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all my fault, sir,&rdquo; he began abruptly, addressing Mr. Everett&mdash;&ldquo;that
      accident on the bay a few weeks back. I was losing my sight, and was just
      going to give up my life on the water when I found that Hugh Masterson had
      died, and that Courage there had set her heart on spending the summer with
      me on the boat. And so I tried for her sake to hold on a while longer, but
      it wa'nt no use, and I'd like to made an end to us all that evening. I
      wish sometime when ye're aboard the St. Johns ye'd have a word with the
      captain, and tell him how it all happened, and that Larry Starr has not
      touched a drop of liquor these twenty years; he thought I was drunk, you
      know, and no wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I will, Larry, and only too gladly,&rdquo; Mr. Everett promised, drawing
      closer to Larry's side, that they might talk further about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after this Miss Julia made a move to go, not, however, you may be
      sure, until she had seen Courage tucked away in her own bed, and dropping
      off into the soundest sort of a sleep the moment her tired little head
      touched the pillow. But before Miss Julia actually gave the reins to her
      ponies for the homeward drive there was a vigorous hand-shaking on all
      sides, for the exciting experiences of the last hour had made them all
      feel very near to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Julia, we must do something for that precious child,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Everett as soon as the ponies struck the dirt road, and it was less of an
      effort to speak than when their hoofs were clattering noisily on the
      bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what had it best be?&rdquo; asked Miss Julia, and yet with her own mind
      quite made up on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing less than to have her make her home with us always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing less,&rdquo; said Miss Julia earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless her brave heart! nothing less,&rdquo; chimed in Mr. Everett; &ldquo;but what
      will become of poor Larry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      True enough! what would become of poor Larry? and would it be right to ask
      him to make such a sacrifice? It was not necessary, however, to discuss
      all the details of the beautiful plan just then, and even Mr. Everett, who
      had raised the question, had faith to believe that somehow or other
      everything could be satisfactorily arranged. For the remainder of the
      drive home not a word was spoken. People who have just been face to face
      with a great peril, and realize it, are likely to find thoughts in their
      hearts quite too deep for utterance and too solemn.

      L'ENVOI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>ou may not happen
      to know what this &ldquo;l'envoi&rdquo; means. Neither do I exactly, only nowadays
      poets who try to make English poems like French ones put it at the head of
      their last verse; so I have a notion to follow their example and put it at
      the head of this last chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to its meaning as the poets use it, I find that even some pretty wise
      people are not able to enlighten us, so we'll have it mean just what we
      choose, and say that it stands for the winding up of a story by which you
      learn what became of all the people in it. At any rate, as that's what
      this chapter's to be, we'll press this mysterious little L'Envoi into
      service in lieu of such a long title. Confidentially, however, I have an
      idea that it isn't &ldquo;the thing&rdquo; to wind up a story at all. That to give you
      merely an intimation as to what probably happened to Courage, and to leave
      you wholly in ignorance as to the others, would be far more in keeping
      with modern story-telling; but why try to be modern unless it is more
      satisfactory? Then I imagine you really would like to know something more
      of the friends we have been summering with through these eight chapters,
      and besides, if someday you should yourself go driving over the South
      Shrewsbury draw, you would naturally expect to at least have a chat with
      David Starr, feeling that he was a fixture, whatever might have become of
      Larry and Courage and Sylvia. But alas! that cannot be, and you ought to
      know it beforehand. The same little house is there, and in summer weather
      the same boxes of geraniums, verbena, and portulaca line the rail in front
      of it, but the old man at present employed at the draw is as much of a
      stranger to me as to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is several years now since that eventful night on the bridge, and all
      this while Courage has been living in Washington Square, for it had been
      easily arranged with Larry that she should make her home with Miss Julia
      and Mrs. Everett. Indeed, it had proved an immense relief to Larry's
      anxious heart to know that her future would be so well provided for, and
      it all came about at the right time, too, for the very next winter Larry
      died. He had not been feeling well for a few days, and Sylvia, who had
      been left behind at the bridge, wrote for Courage; and Courage, losing not
      a moment, came in time to care for him for two whole weeks before he
      passed away. His illness was not a painful one, and now that complete
      darkness had closed in about him, he had no great wish to live. The many
      mansions of the Father were very real to Larry, and the eyes that were
      blind to all on earth seemed to look with wondrous keenness of vision
      toward &ldquo;the land that is very far off;&rdquo; while to have Courage at his side
      in this last illness summed up every earthly desire that remained to him.
      He was buried in the cemetery over at Shrewsbury, and it was not long
      before a grave was dug for faithful Bruce, who seemed to lose all heart
      from the hour his master left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Courage went back to Washington Square, the day after the funeral,
      Sylvia went with her, to assist in the care of a blessed Everett baby that
      had lately come to gladden every one in the home; and Sylvia was overjoyed
      to be once more under the same roof with Courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a year or two after that David continued to keep the draw, living
      alone in the same way as before, which must have seemed a more lonely way
      than ever, with Larry out of the world and Courage and Sylvia quite the
      same as out of it, as far as he was concerned. But finally David had to
      give up. &ldquo;The rheumatics,&rdquo; as he said, &ldquo;got hold of him so drefful bad
      that there was no help for it but that he must just go and be beholden to
      his daughter,&rdquo; which, as you can imagine, must have been no little trial
      to independent old David.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Courage! brave little Courage! just how does the world fare with her?
      Well, she is quite a young lady by this time, with the beautiful auburn
      curls twisted into a knot, and dresses that sometimes have trains to them,
      and yet she is just the same Courage still. It seems to Mr. and Mrs.
      Everett as though they could hardly have loved their own little Belle
      more, while to Miss Julia it seems as though she could not possibly live
      without her; and no one who truly knows Courage wonders at this for a
      moment. As for Courage herself, she looks up to Miss Julia with all the
      saint-like adoration of the old sewing-school days, and Miss Julia is
      every whit worthy of such loyal devotion. At the same time, they are the
      best of friends.

    </h5>
    <p>
      During these five years of daily companionship Miss Julia has been
      unconsciously training Courage to be just such another noble woman as she
      is herself, and so they have been constantly growing nearer and still
      nearer to each other, if that were possible. They love the same books,
      they enjoy the same things, and now that regular school-life is over for
      Courage, they have the happiest sort of time together, day in and day out.
      Often, indeed, they have a very merry time of it, largely accounted for by
      the fact that Courage, being well and strong, as well as young, is often
      brimming over with a contagious buoyancy, sometimes called animal spirits,
      but to my thinking, it deserves a better name than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everywhere that Miss Julia goes Courage goes too that is, if she is wanted
      (and seldom is she not), and one of the places where they go most
      frequently, and never empty-handed, is to a great hospital, where, since
      little lame Joe died, Mary Duff has become one of the sisters who give
      their lives to caring for sick children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courage even has a class next to Miss Julia's in the sewing-school where
      she used to be a scholar. Now and then she feels some little finger
      pointing at her, and knows well enough what is being said. One Saturday
      afternoon, when on her way to the chapel, she noticed two rather unkempt
      little specimens in close conference. &ldquo;Yes, that's her,&rdquo; she heard the
      smaller girl exclaim as she neared them, &ldquo;and ain't she sweet and stylish!
      Well, she used to belong down here somewhere, but now she lives in a
      beautiful house with Miss Julia in Washington Square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like as not she didn't do nothin' to deserve it, either,&rdquo; said the larger
      girl enviously, with a sullen shrug of her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't do nothin'? Well, perhaps you don't know that she just saved Miss
      Julia's life; that's something, ain't it?&rdquo; And with the color mantling
      forehead and cheeks Courage hurried on, grateful for the championship of
      her unknown little friend.

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
